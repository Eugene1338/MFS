I had to find you
Slow motion horror was everywhere
Your safety was my only care
And then I catch you
As all the terrified people run
Two silhouettes become one

The sky the deepest red
The sun the bleakest black
We hold each other and hail
The final act

An old man grabbed me
Clad in a velveteen cloak and hood
Screaming fear and weeping blood
Well, let them panic
We're hypnotised from above - no time
No time for fear, just for love
The sky the deepest red
The sun the bleakest black
All words are worthless now
There's no way back
Relax and enjoy the show

Now welcome dear apocalypse
We dance in raining stars
We turn this nightmare into bliss
Snowing fire and raining stars
Snowing fire and raining stars

On the horizon
Blue silver thunderbolts
stole our breath
The warm embrace of facing death
This sweet defiance
Your eyes ignite in the fumes
Just like diamonds in the blood moon

The sky the deepest red
The sun the bleakest black
Each second ours to share
So make them last

Now welcome dear apocalypse
We dance in raining stars
We turn this nightmare into bliss
Snowing fire and raining stars
Snowing fire and raining stars

No need to list regret
There's no way back

Now welcome dear apocalypse
We dance in raining stars
We turn this nightmare into bliss
Snowing fire and raining stars
Snowing fire and raining stars
